# Healthcare Imaging Analysis 

## Purpose

This code is designed for detecting and highlighting potential fractures in X-ray images, aiding radiologists and healthcare professionals in identifying abnormalities quickly and accurately.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – For general programming and data processing.  
- **OpenCV** – For image processing, including edge detection and contour analysis.  
- **NumPy** – For efficient matrix and numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib** – For visualizing the original and annotated X-ray images.  

## Usage

1. **Upload the X-ray image** using Google Colab’s file upload feature.  
2. The code **preprocesses the image**, detecting edges and isolating the largest connected contour, which likely represents a fracture or significant bone structure.  
3. It **highlights this region** with a green bounding box, providing a visual cue for further examination.

## Conclusion

This code provides a foundational approach to automated fracture detection in medical imaging. It offers a fast, initial assessment tool that can reduce manual screening time, potentially improving diagnostic efficiency. However, for clinical use, it would require further refinement to handle various fracture types and account for different bone structures.
